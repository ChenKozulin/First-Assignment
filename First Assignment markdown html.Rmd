## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r ex.1}
ex.1 <- read.csv("ex1.csv")
ex.1
x<-ex.1$height
x
mean(x)
median(x)
hist(ex.1$height)
boxplot(ex.1$height)
summary(ex.1$height)
freq <- table(ex.1) 
cumsum(freq)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r height, echo=FALSE}
hist(ex.1$height)
boxplot(ex.1$height)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
