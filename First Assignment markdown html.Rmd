## R Markdown

This R Markdown document includes a script for reading data from an external file, displaying paramters of the data you want, calculation of mean and median of the chosen parameter, several types of graphs of the data, data summary, data frequencies and cumulative frequencies.  

```{r ex.1}
ex.1 <- read.csv("ex1.csv")
ex.1
x<-ex.1$height
x
mean(x)
median(x)
hist(ex.1$height)
boxplot(ex.1$height)
summary(ex.1$height)
freq <- table(ex.1) 
cumsum(freq)
```

## Including Plots

histogram and boxplots of height

```{r height, echo=FALSE}
hist(ex.1$height)
boxplot(ex.1$height)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
